Local development — containers
---

Requirements: rootless Podman & Docker Compose 2 (or Docker & Docker Compose 2).

    git clone https://github.com/TomaszGasior/RadioLista-v3.git
    cd RadioLista-v3
    cp compose.override.yaml.dist compose.override.yaml
    docker compose up

After containers building process, the first start of the application can take
**more than one minute**: dependencies installation and database with example
data are handled automatically.

The web application will be started at `http://127.0.0.1:2012`.
MySQL database will be available at `127.0.0.1:2013`.
Ports can be customized in `compose.override.yaml` file.

Default administrator user account name is `radiolista`. Each user account
generated by data fixtures has password equal to its name.

### These features are not supposed to work

* List searching — this requires MySQL/MariaDB database instead of SQLite.
* Exporting lists to PDF format — this requires `wkhtmltopdf` CLI utility.

Tests
---

    bin/phpunit

Fresh SQLite database for test environment is generated automatically each time
PHPUnit is started.
